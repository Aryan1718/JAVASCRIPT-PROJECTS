      The purpose of the project is to learn the different properties of events, with one of the most famous properties being the X and Y coordinate values. In this project, I have created a simple black box. Whenever a user clicks inside the black box at a particular position, a small red circle will appear. To learn more about the code, please check out my Medium article.
